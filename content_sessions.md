In this session we take a look at some of the bindings available to you and how you might go about creating your own custom bindings using the binding extensibility framework.

But how can you navigate the maze of Integration Services? In this session Wagner Silveira (Azure MVP) will explain who is who on the Azure world when it comes to integration - from API Management to Service Bus, passing through Logic Apps, Event Grid and Functions, they will show you what those services are, how can you use and when you should use it, following by some hands on exercises.

This session is going to look at an example infrastructure solution and the approaches you can take to modernising it when moving to Azure. We will take a quick look at what the equivalent will be when leveraging IaaS in Azure, followed by a preferred scenario of leveraging PaaS in Azure. To wrap up we will take a glance into some of the operational services available to build a complete solution. You will then go and follow a lab to build out the solution just covered.
