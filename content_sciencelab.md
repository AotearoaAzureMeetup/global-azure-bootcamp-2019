## Global Azure Science Lab 2019

Have you ever wanted to discover a planet? How about discovering a planet around another star?

We are super excited about the lab this year and have once again teamed up with the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias in Tenerife to bring you something really interesting, read below for a message direct from the team at IAC.

For more information about this project, head over to the [Introduction](https://global.azurebootcamp.net/global-azure-science-lab-2019/).

**You can contribute to this awesome project while learning Azure at the same time!**
**You can run this hands-on-lab through-out the day.**
**You will be running the client in your Azure subscription (in VMs, AKS Kubernetes clusters, ACI any many others).**
**Just follow the [Deployment Instructions](https://github.com/intelequia/GAB2019ScienceLab) and use lab information below.**
