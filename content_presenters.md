_Principal Consultant and Product Manager @ Fusion5_

As a Cloud consultant for the past 6 years, I have seen the journey and sentiment about moving to the cloud of many customers. It is no longer a 'should we' question, but rather a 'when' question. As a Principal Consultant leading a team of Cloud Architects and Engineers, I have had the unique front seat to watching this transform the way our clients do business. As a Product Manager, I have the unique opportunity to listen to some of my really smart colleagues and combine that with what my customers need which helps me shape Fusion5 journey with Cloud Technology, especially Microsoft Azure.
